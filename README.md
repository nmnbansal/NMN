Bare Metal -

The term "bare metal" refers to a hard disk, the usual medium on which a computer's OS(operating System)is installed. The term virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual version of something, such as an OS(Operating System), a server or a network resource.

Bare Metal Server-

A 'bare-metal server' is a computer server that is a 'single-tenant physical server'. The term is used nowadays to distinguish it from modern forms of virtualization and cloud hosting. Bare-metal servers have a single 'tenant'. They are not shared between custom

Dedicated servers provide powerful performance and isolated security, and cloud servers give flexibility of resources and pay-as-you-use billing. Bare metal servers combine those features into one best-of-both-worlds server solution

Why ??

Because of the unique combination of high performance and flexibility, bare metal servers have a wide variety of use cases for short-term, resource-intensive needs.

VMware -

VMware Workstation is a virtual machine software that is used for x86 and x86-64 computers to run multiple operating systems over a single physical host computer. Each virtual machine can run a single instance of any operating system (Microsoft, Linux, etc.) simultaneously.

Why ??

VMware Server is a virtualization product that makes it possible to partition a single physical server into multiple virtual machines. VMware Server facilitates software testing in virtual machines without installation and configuration. Patches and experimental operating systems can be tested as well.

Hypervisor -

hypervisor, is virtualization software that is installed on hardware directly. At its core, the hypervisor is the host or operating system. It is structured to allow for the virtualization of underlying hardware components to function as if they have direct access to the hardware

What is a purpose of hypervisor??

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a process that creates and runs virtual machines . A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, like memory and processing. Generally, there are two types of hypervisors.

NOTE:- KVM - Kernel based virtual machine. Hyper-V -Windows Server Virtualization.

Virtual Machine -

A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.

A virtual machine app creates a virtualized environment,a virtual machine that behaves like a separate computer system, complete with virtual hardware devices. The VM runs as a process in a window on your current operating system.The VM app presents this file the guest OS as a real hard drive.

Page Rank algorithm -

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages

Inventer- Larry page,Sergey Brin.

PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

Onion Routing -

Onion routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. In an onion network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to layers of an onion. There is a large set of precautionary measures and best practices to make web browsing safer and more secure for users.

TOR (The Onion Router)

Tor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe.

Written in: C,Python,Rust.

Namespace -

Namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. A namespace ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

Jail Break =

Jailbreaking means bypassing the restrictions Apple puts on the operating system and taking full control of the device. With a jailbroken device, you can install apps and tweaks that aren't authorized by Apple, but you also remove the tough security protections that Apple has built into iOS
